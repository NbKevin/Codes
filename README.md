## Codes

Codes is a final project for the course *Generating and Expressing Data* at NYU Shanghai, IMA, taught by Professor Feng Xiaoyang. This project collects and presents the code I have written since college and their stories in a *geek* fashion.

#### Run
Codes is made with p5.js and nothing else. An optional Python Flask application is involved as a default web server provider. However, one should be able to render `index.html` with no problem as from a local source.

#### Voice Synthesis
Codes makes use of the experimental `WebSpeech` API. It is non a standard feature yet and has different implementation across browsers and platforms. Most mainstream desktop operating system provides at least one TTS engine. Chrome offers its own TTS web service and it recommended for experiencing this project.

#### Licence
Codes is licensed under *Don't Be A Dick Public License*. See more information at `LICENSE.md` or at [Don't Be A Dick](http://www.dbad-license.org).
