Processing is an open source computer programming
language and integrated development environment (IDE)
built for the electronic arts, new media art, and
visual design communities with the purpose of teaching
the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual
context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic
sketchbooks.

The project was initiated in 2001 by Casey Reas and
Benjamin Fry, both formerly of the Aesthetics and
Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab. In 2012, they
started the Processing Foundation along with Daniel
Shiffman, who joined as a third project lead.

One of the aims of Processing is to allow non-programmers
to start computer programming aided by visual feedback.
The Processing language builds on the Java language, but
uses a simplified syntax and a graphics user interface.

Processing includes a sketchbook, a minimal alternative
to an integrated development environment (IDE) for
organizing projects.

Every Processing sketch is actually a subclass of the
PApplet Java class which implements most of the
Processing language's features.

When programming in Processing, all additional classes
defined will be treated as inner classes when the code
is translated into pure Java before compiling. This
means that the use of static variables and methods in
classes is prohibited unless you explicitly tell
Processing that you want to code in pure Java mode.

Processing also allows for users to create their own
classes within the PApplet sketch. This allows for
complex data types that can include any number of
arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using
standard data types such as: int (integer), char
(character), float (real number), and color (RGB,
ARGB, hex).

Processing's core libraries, the code included in
exported applications and applets, is licensed under
the GNU Lesser General Public License, allowing users
to release their original code with a choice of license.

The IDE is licensed under the GNU General Public License.
